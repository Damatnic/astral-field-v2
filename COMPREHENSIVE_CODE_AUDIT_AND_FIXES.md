## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive audit of the Astral Field V1 codebase, identifying and fixing critical issues, improving code quality, and implementing best practices.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Heroicons v1 to v2 Migration (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Issue:** Application was using Heroicons v1 import syntax but had v2 installed, causing runtime errors.

**Error:**
```
Error: You're trying to import `@heroicons/react/outline/SparklesIcon` from Heroicons v1 but have installed Heroicons v2.
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated all 15 component files from `@heroicons/react/outline` to `@heroicons/react/24/outline`
- Files fixed:
  - AI Coach components (3 files)
  - Analytics dashboard
  - Chat components
  - Draft room
  - Leagues browser
  - Live scoring components (2 files)
  - Notifications
  - Player components (3 files)
  - Team lineup manager
  - Trade center

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

### 2. Console Statements Audit

**Issue:** 484+ console.log/error/warn statements found across the codebase.

**Analysis:**
- Most console statements are in test files (acceptable)
- Some debug console statements in production code (needs cleanup)
- Auth debug statements properly gated behind `AUTH_DEBUG` environment variable (good)

**Recommendations:**
1. Keep test console statements
2. Remove or gate production console statements behind environment checks
3. Use proper logging library for production (Winston, Pino, etc.)

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### 3. TODO/FIXME Comments Audit

**Found:** 188 TODO/FIXME/HACK comments

**Categories:**
1. **Feature Implementations (High Priority):**
   - Weather API integration for player analytics
   - Injury reports integration
   - Schedule difficulty calculations
   - Power rankings calculations
   - Playoff probability calculations

2. **Security Enhancements (Medium Priority):**

- ✅ AUTH_DEBUG (for development)
- ✅ NODE_ENV

**Recommendations:**
1. Add environment variable validation at startup
2. Document all required environment variables
3. Add .env.example with all variables

---

### 9. Database Schema

**Current State:** EXCELLENT ✅

Prisma Schema:
- Well-structured models
- Proper relationships
- Indexes in place
- Migrations managed

**No immediate improvements needed**

---

### 10. API Routes
