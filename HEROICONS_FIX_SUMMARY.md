# Heroicons v1 to v2 Migration - Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was using Heroicons v1 import syntax (`@heroicons/react/outline`) but had Heroicons v2 installed, causing runtime errors:

```
Error: You're trying to import `@heroicons/react/outline/SparklesIcon` from Heroicons v1 but have installed Heroicons v2.
```

## Solution
Updated all Heroicons imports from v1 syntax to v2 syntax across the entire codebase.

### Changes Made
- **Old syntax:** `from '@heroicons/react/outline'`
- **New syntax:** `from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'`

## Verification
All imports have been successfully updated. No instances of the old import syntax remain in the codebase.

## Next Steps
1. Test the application to ensure all icons render correctly
2. Check for any remaining console errors
3. Verify that all components using Heroicons are functioning properly

## Additional Notes
- Heroicons v2 uses size-specific imports (`/24/outline`, `/24/solid`, `/20/solid`, etc.)
- The most common size is 24px, which is what we've used for all outline icons
- If you need different sizes in the future, use:
  - `/20/solid` for 20px solid icons
  - `/24/solid` for 24px solid icons
  - `/16/solid` for 16px solid icons (mini icons)

## Date
Fixed: 2025-01-XX

## Status
âœ… Complete - All Heroicons imports have been migrated to v2 syntax
