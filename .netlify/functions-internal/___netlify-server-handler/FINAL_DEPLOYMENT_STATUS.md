## 🎉 **Conclusion**

**The Sleeper integration is 100% technically complete.** All TypeScript issues have been resolved, the local build succeeds, and all code is properly committed to GitHub. 

**The only remaining step is triggering a proper Vercel deployment**, which is a platform configuration issue rather than a code issue. Once the manual deployment is triggered, the entire Sleeper integration system will be live and functional.
