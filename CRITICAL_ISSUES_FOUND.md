# CRITICAL ISSUES - FANTASY FOOTBALL PLATFORM

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. BLOCKCHAIN/NFT/FANTASY CASH - SHOULD NOT EXIST
- `/src/app/api/blockchain/` - ENTIRE FOLDER NEEDS DELETION
- `/src/components/blockchain/FantasyRewardsHub.tsx` - DELETE
- Fantasy cash/tokens/NFT features throughout - REMOVE ALL
- These features don't belong in a dynasty league platform

### 2. SCORING SYSTEM NOT CONNECTED TO DATABASE
- Live scoring returns mock/hardcoded data
- Projections not pulling from actual player data
- Points calculation not working
- No real integration with Sleeper API for scores

### 3. AUTHENTICATION COMPLETELY BROKEN
- Simple login expects hardcoded users
- No real user database connection
- Session management not working
- Login page doesn't actually authenticate

### 4. MOCK DATA EVERYWHERE
- `/src/app/api/leagues/[id]/activity/route.ts` - Returns mock data
- `/src/app/api/trades/create/route.ts` - Mock implementation
- `/src/app/api/trades/[id]/analyze/route.ts` - Fake analysis
- `/src/app/api/my-matchup/route.ts` - Hardcoded matchups
- Analytics page - All data is hardcoded
- Chat page - Fake messages
- Commissioner page - Static member list

## ðŸŸ  HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 5. DATABASE NOT PROPERLY INTEGRATED
- Most API routes don't actually query the database
- Prisma schema exists but not used consistently
- No real data persistence

### 6. SLEEPER API INTEGRATION INCOMPLETE
- Not fetching real player stats
- Not syncing league data
- Not pulling live scores
- Not getting real projections

### 7. USER MANAGEMENT BROKEN
- No real user creation
- No team assignment
- No role management
- No proper league membership

### 8. TRADE SYSTEM NOT FUNCTIONAL
- Trade creation doesn't persist
- Trade analysis is fake
- No actual player value calculations
- No trade history

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 9. WAIVER SYSTEM NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Waiver claims don't work
- No waiver processing logic
- No priority system

### 10. DRAFT SYSTEM ISSUES
- WebSocket implementation exists but not connected to database
- Picks aren't persisted
- No real draft board
- Auto-pick logic missing

### 11. MATCHUP SYSTEM PROBLEMS
- Hardcoded playoff brackets
- No dynamic matchup generation
- Scores not calculated from player stats

### 12. MISSING FEATURES
- No lineup optimization
- No injury predictions (returns mock data)
- No real notifications
- No email integration

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY (BUT STILL IMPORTANT)

### 13. UI/UX ISSUES
- Error handling inconsistent
- Loading states not properly implemented
- No proper empty states
- Missing validation

### 14. PERFORMANCE ISSUES
- No caching strategy
- API routes not optimized
- Database queries inefficient

### 15. DEPLOYMENT ISSUES
- Environment variables not properly configured
- Vercel protection blocking access
- No proper staging environment

## FILES TO DELETE IMMEDIATELY

```
/src/app/api/blockchain/
/src/components/blockchain/
/src/lib/blockchain/
```

## FILES NEEDING COMPLETE REWRITE

```
/src/app/api/auth/simple-login/route.ts
/src/app/api/scoring/live/route.ts
/src/app/api/scoring/projections/route.ts
/src/app/api/leagues/[id]/activity/route.ts
/src/app/api/trades/create/route.ts
/src/app/api/trades/[id]/analyze/route.ts
/src/app/api/my-matchup/route.ts
/src/app/analytics/page.tsx
/src/app/chat/page.tsx
/src/app/commissioner/page.tsx
```

## WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING

- Basic page routing
- UI components render
- Some Sleeper API connections
- Avatar generation
- Basic health checks

## ESTIMATED COMPLETION

Based on the issues found, this platform is approximately **30% complete** at best. The core functionality (scoring, authentication, database integration) is not working.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

1. DELETE all blockchain/NFT/fantasy cash code
2. FIX authentication to use real database
3. CONNECT scoring system to Sleeper API and database
4. IMPLEMENT real user management
5. REPLACE all mock data with database queries
6. COMPLETE Sleeper API integration
7. FIX trade system
8. IMPLEMENT waiver system
9. COMPLETE draft functionality
10. TEST everything thoroughly

This is a MAJOR overhaul needed, not minor fixes.
