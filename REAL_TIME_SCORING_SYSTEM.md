# Real-Time Scoring Engine - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive real-time scoring engine for the fantasy football platform. The system provides live scoring updates during NFL games with automatic activation, intelligent timing, and robust error handling.

## System Components

### 1. Live Scoring API (`/api/scoring/live`)
- **Location**: `src/app/api/scoring/live/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - GET endpoint for retrieving live scores
  - POST endpoints for controlling live updates
  - Multiple response formats (detailed, summary, scores_only)
  - Automatic week detection and historical score calculation
  - Comprehensive caching strategy

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Get live scores for a league
GET /api/scoring/live?leagueId=123&format=detailed

# Start live tracking
POST /api/scoring/live?action=start_live_tracking
{ "leagueId": "123", "options": { "intervalMs": 60000 } }

# Force refresh scores
POST /api/scoring/live?action=refresh
{ "leagueId": "123" }
```

  - Added live scoring context to analytics response
  - Fallback mechanisms for when live data is unavailable
  - Integration with real-time scoring service

### 6. WebSocket Real-Time Updates
- **Location**: `src/app/api/socket/route.ts` & `src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time score broadcasting to connected clients
  - League-specific subscriptions
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - React hooks for easy frontend integration
  - Game status updates and orchestrator status

### 7. Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Location**: `src/services/scoring/errorHandler.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Circuit breaker pattern for service protection
  - Multi-tier fallback system (cache → database → mock → none)
  - Error tracking and recovery recommendations
  - Service health monitoring
  - Automatic recovery mechanisms

## API Endpoints

### Live Scoring
- `GET /api/scoring/live` - Get live scores for a league
- `POST /api/scoring/live` - Control live scoring operations

### WebSocket
- `GET /api/socket` - WebSocket endpoint information
- `POST /api/socket` - WebSocket server control

### Analytics (Enhanced)
- `GET /api/analytics` - Now includes live scoring data and top player performance

## Frontend Integration

### React Hook Usage
```typescript
import { useLeagueWebSocket } from '@/hooks/useWebSocket';

function LeagueScoreboard({ leagueId }) {
  const { 
    liveScores, 
    gameStatus, 
    state 
  } = useLeagueWebSocket(leagueId);

  if (state.connected && liveScores) {
    return <ScoreDisplay scores={liveScores} />;
  }

  return <LoadingState />;
}
```

### Direct API Usage
```typescript
// Fetch live scores
const response = await fetch(`/api/scoring/live?leagueId=${leagueId}`);
const { data } = await response.json();

// Start live updates
await fetch('/api/scoring/live?action=start_live_tracking', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ leagueId, options: { intervalMs: 60000 } })
});
```

## Configuration

### Scoring Orchestrator Settings
```typescript
const config = {
  gameTimeInterval: 60000,      // 1 minute during games
  nonGameTimeInterval: 300000,  // 5 minutes during non-game times
  autoStart: true,              // Auto-start during game times
  autoStop: true,               // Auto-stop during non-game times
  minUpdateInterval: 30000,     // 30 seconds minimum
  maxUpdateInterval: 900000     // 15 minutes maximum
};
```

### WebSocket Events
- `subscribe_league` - Subscribe to league updates
- `unsubscribe_league` - Unsubscribe from league
- `score_update` - Live score data
- `game_status_update` - Game status changes
- `error` - Error notifications

## Database Integration

### Compatible Tables
- `League` - League information and current week
- `Team` - Team data and roster information
- `Matchup` - Week matchups and scores
- `Player` - Player information
- `PlayerStats` - Weekly player statistics
- `PlayerProjection` - Projected points
- `RosterPlayer` - Team rosters and positions

### No Schema Changes Required
The system works with the existing database schema without requiring any modifications.

## Performance Features

### Caching Strategy
- Redis/Memory cache for live scores (1-5 minute TTL)
- Database fallback for historical data
- Mock data generation as last resort

### Rate Limiting Protection
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents API abuse
- Automatic backoff during errors
- Intelligent retry logic with exponential delays

### Resource Optimization
- Updates only during NFL game hours
- Dynamic interval adjustment based on game status
- Automatic service hibernation during off-season

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### 3-Tier Fallback System

2. **Secondary**: Cached data from previous updates
3. **Tertiary**: Database historical data
4. **Emergency**: Mock data generation

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker protection
- Service health monitoring
- Graceful degradation

## Testing

Run comprehensive system tests:
```bash
node scripts/test-live-scoring.js
```

Tests include:
- API endpoint functionality
- Data integrity verification
- Error handling validation
- Performance benchmarking
- WebSocket connectivity
- Analytics integration

## Production Deployment Considerations

- League access verification
- No sensitive data exposure

### Rate Limiting
- Built-in circuit breakers
- API call throttling
- Resource protection

## Future Enhancements
