# 🔄 Restart Dev Server to Fix Dashboard

## The Issue
You successfully sign in, but dashboard shows 500 error.

## The Fix
The dashboard fix is already in your code - just restart the dev server!

## Steps:

### 1. Stop Current Dev Server
In the terminal where dev server is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C`

### 2. Start Dev Server Again
```bash
cd C:\_ASTRAL_PROJECTS\ASTRAL_FIELD_V1\apps\web
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Signin Again
1. Go to: http://localhost:3001/auth/signin
2. Click "Quick Select"
3. Click any player (try Jack McCaigue!)
4. Should now load dashboard successfully! 🎉

## What Was Fixed
Changed database field names in dashboard:
- ❌ `userId` → ✅ `ownerId`
- ❌ `team1/team2` → ✅ `homeTeam/awayTeam`
- ❌ `team1Score/team2Score` → ✅ `homeScore/awayScore`
- ❌ `player.team` → ✅ `player.nflTeam`

---

## Expected Result

After signin, you should see:
- ✅ Your team name and record
- ✅ Recent matchup history
- ✅ Top 3 players on your roster
- ✅ Quick action buttons
- ✅ No 500 errors!

## If Still Getting 500 Error

Check terminal output for specific error message and tell me what it says.
