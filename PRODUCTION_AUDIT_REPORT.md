## 📝 NOTES

This audit reveals that while the Astral Field platform has a solid technical foundation with Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma, it requires substantial development work before it can safely host a real fantasy football league. The current state presents significant security risks and functional gaps that must be addressed systematically.

The recommended approach is to halt new feature development and focus intensively on the critical fixes outlined in Phase 1, then methodically work through the core functionality in phases 2-4. With dedicated effort, this platform can become production-ready, but it will require significant time investment and careful attention to security and data integrity.
