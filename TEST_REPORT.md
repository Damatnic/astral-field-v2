## üìã DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ Ready
- [x] All critical errors fixed
- [x] Core APIs functional
- [x] Database connected
- [x] Frontend pages loading
- [x] Sleeper integration working
- [x] Error handling improved

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Before Production
- [ ] Implement proper authentication flow
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors for better maintainability
- [ ] Add rate limiting to public endpoints
- [ ] Configure environment variables for production
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Enable Sentry error tracking

### üîí Security Considerations

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions
1. **Deploy to Staging** - Application is stable enough for staging deployment
2. **Test with Real Users** - Have the 10 league members test authentication
3. **Monitor Performance** - Watch for any production-specific issues

### Short-term Improvements
1. Fix TypeScript errors for code quality
2. Implement proper user authentication flow
3. Add comprehensive error logging
4. Create user onboarding flow

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Add automated E2E tests
2. Implement CI/CD pipeline
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Create admin dashboard
