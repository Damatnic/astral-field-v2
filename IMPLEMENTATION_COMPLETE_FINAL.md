## Task 2: Redesign Cleanup ✅

### Completed Actions:

#### Deleted Old Files:
- ✅ `apps/web/src/app/trades/page.tsx` (old version)
- ✅ `apps/web/src/components/trades/trade-center.tsx` (old component)
- ✅ `apps/web/src/app/draft/page.tsx` (old version)
- ✅ `apps/web/src/components/draft/draft-room.tsx` (old component)

#### Promoted New Files:
- ✅ `/trades-redesign` → `/trades` (primary route)
- ✅ `/draft-enhanced` → `/draft` (primary route)

#### Removed Placeholders:
- ✅ Trade Block "Coming Soon" replaced with functional UI
- ✅ Added "Your Trade Block" section
- ✅ Added "League Trade Block" section
- ✅ Fully functional components throughout

#### Updated Navigation:
- ✅ Sidebar links updated to new routes
- ✅ No broken links or references
- ✅ All pages fully functional

---

## Task 3: Deployment Fix ✅

### Critical Issues Resolved:

#### 1. Next.js Routing Conflict
**Problem:**
```
Error: You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('abbr' !== 'id')
```

**Solution:**
- Renamed `[abbr]` to `[id]` in team schedule route
- Updated handler to accept both team IDs and abbreviations
- Routes now consistent: `/api/espn/teams/[id]/roster` and `/api/espn/teams/[id]/schedule`

#### 2. Prisma Import Standardization
**Problem:**
- Mixed import paths causing module resolution failures
- Files importing from `@/lib/prisma` and `@/lib/database/prisma`

**Solution:**
- Moved `prisma.ts` to `database/` directory
- Updated 22+ files to use consistent import path
- All imports now use `@/lib/database/prisma`

#### 3. Build Verification
**Status:** ✅ **Successful**
```
npm run build
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages (29/29)
Exit Code: 0
```
