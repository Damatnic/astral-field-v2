- A league invitation code to enter on the platform
- A custom league URL to visit and register

## Team Management

### Roster and Lineup

**Q: How many players can I have on my roster?**
A: Standard roster sizes typically include:
- Starting lineup: 9 players (QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, TE, FLEX, K, DST)
- Bench: 6-8 players
- Total roster: 15-17 players
Your league's specific settings may vary.

**Q: What is the FLEX position?**
A: The FLEX position allows you to start a Running Back, Wide Receiver, or Tight End. This gives you flexibility in your lineup based on matchups and player performance.

**Q: When do lineups lock?**
A: Individual player lineups typically lock when their NFL game begins. For example, if there's a Thursday Night Football game, those players lock on Thursday, while Sunday players lock on Sunday.

**Q: What happens if I don't set my lineup?**
A: If you don't set your lineup, the system will typically:
- Keep your previous week's lineup if all players are active
- Automatically substitute bench players for inactive starters
- May result in empty lineup spots if no valid substitutions are available

### Scoring

**Q: How is scoring calculated?**
A: Standard scoring typically includes:
- **Passing**: 1 point per 25 yards, 6 points per TD, -2 per interception
- **Rushing/Receiving**: 1 point per 10 yards, 6 points per TD
- **Receptions**: 1 point per catch (PPR leagues)
- **Kicking**: 3-5 points per field goal, 1 point per extra point
- **Defense**: Points based on points allowed, sacks, turnovers, TDs

Your league may use custom scoring settings.

**Q: What is PPR scoring?**
A: PPR stands for "Points Per Reception." In PPR leagues, players receive 1 point for each catch in addition to yardage and touchdown points. This makes pass-catching running backs and slot receivers more valuable.

## Transactions

### Waivers and Free Agency

**Q: What's the difference between waivers and free agency?**
A: 
- **Waivers**: Players dropped or unclaimed must go through a waiting period (usually 1-2 days) where all teams can submit claims
- **Free Agency**: Players available immediately without waiting, typically on a first-come, first-served basis

**Q: How does waiver priority work?**
A: Waiver priority typically works in one of two ways:
- **Rolling List**: Team with highest priority gets their claim, then moves to last
- **FAAB (Free Agent Acquisition Budget)**: Teams bid blind auction-style with a budget

**Q: What is FAAB?**
A: FAAB stands for Free Agent Acquisition Budget. Each team gets a budget (typically $100-$1000) to bid on waiver wire players throughout the season. Highest bid wins the player.

**Q: When do waivers process?**
A: Waivers typically process overnight on Wednesday mornings, though your league may have different settings. Check your league's waiver schedule in the settings.

### Trading

**Q: How do I propose a trade?**
A: 
1. Go to the "Trade Center" or "Players" section
2. Select the team you want to trade with
3. Choose players from both rosters to include in the trade
4. Add any draft picks or FAAB money if applicable
5. Submit the proposal with an optional message

**Q: How long do trade offers last?**
A: Trade offers typically expire after 48-72 hours unless accepted, rejected, or withdrawn. Some leagues may have different expiration settings.

**Q: Can trades be vetoed?**
A: Yes, depending on your league settings:
- **Commissioner Review**: Commissioner must approve all trades
- **League Vote**: League members can vote to veto unfair trades
- **No Review**: Trades process automatically unless clearly illegal

**Q: When is the trade deadline?**
A: Most leagues set their trade deadline around Week 10-13 of the NFL season. Check your league settings for the exact date.
