## Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Execute Phase 1 Critical Fixes ⚡
**Priority: CRITICAL - Do this NOW**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd C:\Users\damat\_REPOS\ASTRAL_FIELD_V1

# Run the Phase 1 setup script
node scripts/phase1-critical-setup.js

# Test the build
npm run build

# Check for errors - should now pass without critical issues
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All static assets created
- ✅ CSP violations resolved  
- ✅ Build warnings eliminated
- ✅ PWA functionality enabled

### Step 2: Deploy to Staging for Validation ⚡
**Priority: HIGH - Validate fixes work**

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel staging
vercel --env=staging

# Check the deployed site for:
# - Fonts loading correctly
# - No 404 errors for static assets
# - Manifest.json accessible
# - Service worker registered
```

### Step 3: Execute Phase 2 Real Data Migration ⚡
**Priority: HIGH - Replace mock data**

```bash
# Run database migration
npm run db:migrate:deploy

# Execute the real data setup
node scripts/phase2-real-data-setup.js

# Seed the database with league data
npm run db:seed:prod
```

## League Member Onboarding Process

### Automated Account Creation
The Phase 2 script creates accounts for all 10 league members:

1. **Nicholas D'Amato** (Commissioner) - Buffalo Blitzkrieg
2. **Nick Hartley** - Kansas City Crushers  
3. **Jack McCaigue** - Philly Phenoms
4. **Larry McCaigue** - Gang Green Gridiron
5. **Renee McCaigue** - Patriot Power
6. **Jon Kornbeck** - Green Bay Gladiators
7. **David Jarvey** - Big Blue Bandits
8. **Kaity Lorbecki** - Motor City Maulers
9. **Cason Minor** - Dallas Dominators
10. **Brittany Bergum** - Minnesota Mavericks

### Email Setup Process
```javascript
// Generate welcome emails with credentials
const credentials = generateUserCredentials();
for (const user of credentials) {
  const email = generateWelcomeEmail(user);
  // Send email to each league member
  console.log(`Send to ${user.email}:`);
  console.log(email);
}
```
